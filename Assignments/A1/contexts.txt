the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place
the jury further said in presentments that the city executive committee which had charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted
the term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the primary which was won by ivan allen
only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city
the jury said it did find that many of registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous
it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments
however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration
the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies
it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem
implementation of automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury
it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes
this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money
the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said
failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers
the jury also commented on the fulton court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee
these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said
regarding new airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable
ask jail deputies
on other matters the jury recommended that
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail
fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department

georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the race a top official said wednesday
robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience
state party chairman james dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held in savannah at which newly elected texas john tower will be the featured speaker
in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters
despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform

the georgia legislature will wind up its session monday and head for home where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly
before adjournment monday afternoon the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made
vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment
vandiver likely will mention the million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item

the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of most heavily traveled highways
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some million to million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work
a revolving fund
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities
vandiver opened his race for governor in with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then marvin griffin
the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds
schley county pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the action of friday in voting itself a per day increase in expense allowances
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of

but he added that none of congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution
the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday
it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises
after a long hot controversy miller county has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the coolest election i ever saw in this county
the new school superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee
davis received votes in election and bush got
ordinary carey williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order
this was the coolest calmest election i ever saw colquitt policeman tom williams said
being at the polls was just like being at church
i smell a drop of liquor and we have a bit of trouble
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however
it was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence
the former county school superintendent george callan shot himself to death march four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board
during the election campaign both candidates davis and bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls
ordinary williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise
everything went real smooth the sheriff said
there a bit of trouble
committee approval of price abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers
daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation
under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it
daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic
it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more
the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared
dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers
if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said
you take out of circulation many millions of dollars
charles hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies
his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor jones of houston brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin
cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday
senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish day schools for the deaf in counties of or more population require deaf children between and years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be which would be a savings of yearly after the first capital outlay of was absorbed parkhouse told the senate
the tea estimated there would be scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between red berry and joe ratcliff
while details are still to be worked out ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected
getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff
but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also
willing to stake my political career on it
berry an from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later
the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health authority to give planning assistance to cities

two tax revision bills were passed
one by louis crump of san saba would aid more than retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized
instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a fine
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league

state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay
an adverse vote of to kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april ballot when texas votes on a senator
wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by majorities before march to be printed on the april ballot roberts said
opponents generally argued that the ballot give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice
all dallas members voted with roberts except bill jones who was absent
paradise lost to the alleged water needs of big cities thursday
james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of people
when the shouting ended the bill passed to sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by george parkhouse of dallas
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and parkhouse
the bill would increase from to the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway attack
the defenders were mostly legislators like buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs
this is a poor bill said chapman
dallas and fort worth can vote bonds
this would help the little peanut districts
a houston teacher now serving in the legislature proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning educational methods
henry grover who teaches history in the houston public schools would reduce from to semester hours the teaching methods courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate
a normal work in college is semester hours
grover also would require high teachers to have at least semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching
the remainder of the college requirement would be in general subjects
a person with a degree in physics chemistry math or english yet who has not taken education courses is not permitted to teach in the public schools said grover
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses
of the representatives immediately joined grover as of the proposal

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program
the report culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm listed long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load
the report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and adc dependency
must solve problem
the monthly cost of adc to more than recipients in the county is million dollars said virgil martin president of carson pirie scott committee chairman
we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence martin said
the volume of adc cases will decrease martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color
these he said are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc
calls for extension
other recommendations made by the committee are
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity
research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest judge james parsons was told in criminal court yesterday
the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements a separate trial
bellows made the request while the jury was out of the courtroom
fears prejudicial aspects
the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court
some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this
yes your honor replied bellows
what this amounts to if true is that there will be a fight in this case
there is a conflict among the defendants
president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio
the president spent much of the at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion
decisions are made
asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say got to go thru several more drafts
salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by demands and proposals for the city
the last cases in the investigation of the election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means
karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the persons
he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens
ruling pertained to eight of the cases
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against persons in precincts by morris wexler special prosecutor
issue jury subpoenas
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury
mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the precinct of the ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning
karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room
he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes
actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east louis sitting in cook county court
faced seven cases
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving persons
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another
the cases involved judges in the and precincts of the ward the and precincts of the ward the precinct of the ward and the precinct of the ward
the case of the judges in the precinct of the ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns
two other cases also were under advisement
claims precedent lacking
after reading his statement discharging the ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them
president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of million americans over who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build new medical and new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research
the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill
it was defeated in congress last year
cost up to a year
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes
the social security payroll tax is now per cent per cent on each worker and employer on the first of pay per year
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to a year and the payroll tax to per cent per cent each
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system
the payroll tax would actually rise to per cent starting if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs
outlays would increase
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run billion or more in the first year
both figures would go higher in later years
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of million to billion dollars over the next years
these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes
nursing home care
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to days for each illness except that the patient would pay a day of the cost for the first nine days
full payment of nursing home bills for up to days following discharge from a hospital
a patient could receive up to days nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the credit
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of a patient
community visiting nurse services at home for up to days an illness
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged
calls proposal modest
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay
this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals
this is not a program of socialized medicine
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital
the plan does not cover doctor bills
they would still be paid by the patient
apart from the aged care plan the most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools
the president said the medical and dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care
moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they afford the schooling costs
contributions to schools
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to a year for of the first year students
the schools could use the money to pay scholarships based on need of up to a year per student
in addition the government would pay a cost of education grant to the schools for each in scholarship grants
officials estimated the combined programs would cost million dollars the first year and would go up to millions by
the president recommended federal matching grants totaling million dollars in years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones
more for nursing homes
in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction
he asked for another million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals
in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the bureau
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute
asks research funds
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation
he did not say by how much
for medical research he asked a million dollar a year increase from to millions in matching grants for building research facilities
the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the million dollars in the budget for direct government research in medicine
the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them
reaction as expected
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines
legislators who last year opposed placing under the social security system criticized the plan
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message
senate republican leader dirksen and house republican leader charles halleck said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first
house speaker sam rayburn called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house
acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert weaver as the federal housing chief
only senators were on the floor and there was no record vote
a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency
in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a hour delay after they are reported to the floor
enforce by demand
the rule was enforced by demand of wayne morse in connection with president cabinet selections in and president in
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes
in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one problems
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence
in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension
the general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive
even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean speeches as inconclusive
but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots
the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months
but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at disposal in european waters
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole
the greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent
this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the most difficult problems in the months to come
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos
the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility
the inclination here is to accept a de facto in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas
but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression
former richard nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union
he was critical of what he feels is president tendency to be too conciliatory
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he attack the kennedy administration on this score
his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups
it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds
nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by nixon and the professors
aid plans revamped
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed
but thus far there has been no response in kind
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations
in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an war over laos
some seato nations disagreed however
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos
the government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the government to the hilt
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them
one factor was the statement of senator fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee
he declared on march that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend
the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david hackett a special assistant to the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since each year showing an increase in offenders
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under years of age
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a director raymond hawksley the present city cd head believes
hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time
east providence now has no civil defense program
hawksley the general treasurer has been a cd director in the city for the last nine years
he is not interested in being named a director
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the civil defense program hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a local director
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs
hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the cd job
one of these men is former fire chief john laughlin he said
along with a director the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized
one advantage that would come to the city in having a director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said
hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point he said and a theater in seekonk would be another
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point
hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack
such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a cd director hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally
one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly
the move into the blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary grant deputy city clerk of central falls
a copy was released to the press
notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july and sent to the state house by miss grant
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review notte said that instead he will take up the matter with joseph nugent to get the benefit of his views
he will then appoint the study committee with cooperation the governor said
i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and groups affected by these laws
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws
should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws
the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday
the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday the resolution said
the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government
the council advised the governor that large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on sunday
they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community
liberals and conservatives in both parties democratic and republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george reama nationally known expert said here yesterday
reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day
he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in
that he added was when he was a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade
that was before i studied law
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track
he steered me to the right track the free enterprise track
he said that when he was a socialist in the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties
reama who retired as vice president of the american screw in said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product but neither told us how to achieve it
he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his philosophy reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own
reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling
a petition bearing the signatures of more than johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town
william martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within days and martinelli happens to hold that post
martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within days
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within days after the board of canvassers completes its work
a difference of opinion arose between martinelli and john bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled
martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while bourcier said that a special election might be called instead
bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures
he assured martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible
martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july to plan further strategy in the charter movement
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes
after inspiring this i think we should certainly follow through on it he declared
it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than members of the group are interested in running on the required ballot for posts on the charter commission
our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement he indicated and to tell them what this will mean for the town
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses
several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at special north providence town council meeting
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael abatuno to draft the ordinance
at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense
james mitchell and walter jones last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard hughes democratic gubernatorial candidate that the gop is campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism
mitchell was for using it jones against and wayne dumont did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before persons at the park hotel
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of clubs
hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired
now gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state
sunday he had added we can love eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign
how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president
he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign he said because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into an old national campaign
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of remark
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign
state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the state senate must share the blame for this
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform
but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said
jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises
he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you have it both ways jones said
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue
earlier mitchell said in a statement
i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard hughes
his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the intentions of the free nations
i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste
such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature
it can only rebound to discredit
sees jones ahead
charles sandman may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination
sandman state campaign chairman for jones was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel newark of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years
sandman said the announcement that clifford case aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mitchell is a dead giveaway
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new problems
we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington
we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mitchell some of the glow of candidacy of last year
that too will fail
sandman announced the appointment of harriet copeland greenfield of woodland westfield as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee
greenfield is president of the westfield republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman
county supervisor weldon sheets who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them
the proposal sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a lip service word
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a period without interest or charge
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines
the candidacy of mayor james sheeran of west orange for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county was supported today by edward roos west orange public safety commissioner
sheeran a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican candidate freeholder william macdonald for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy now a member of the state board of tax appeals
my experience as public safety commissioner roos said has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer
jim sheeran fits that description
william seidel state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development has retired after years of service
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state
seidel joined the department in as a division fire warden after graduation in from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies
in october he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section

he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens
he is credited with setting up an annual fire prevention program in with the red cross and state department of education
richard hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state
he promised nearly democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn when i come back here after the november election think my man the kind of governor glad we elected
he said we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time
in his only attack on the republicans hughes said the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary
but have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform
not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson
take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november
he said you can see signs of the feeble attack on the meyner administration
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead
he urged new jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry
we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said
to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early
calling the democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people hughes asked a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november
hughes supported green acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development
he said legislation for a million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday
the plan will provide million for purchase of open land by the state
the other million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis
hughes said this is not a plan to conquer space but to conserve it pointing out the state population has increased each year since
he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans
after the primary he promised be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration
not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee
fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring voluntarily this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues
the outgoing members whose terms will expire a week after the april primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by
there may be other state committee retirements come april but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters
a special presentation was made to geraldine thompson of red bank who is stepping down after years on the committee
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early following adoption of the suffrage amendment
she served one term on the national committee
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul screvane and abraham beame as running mates
at the same time reaction among democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the reported plan was generally favorable
some democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders
some viewed this attempt as evidence that wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose wagner for the mayoral nomination in the democratic primary
these contend there is a serious question as to whether wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city
their view is that changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader
mayor visits buckley
as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine de sapio the manhattan leader
he is publicly on record as believing de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party
last night the mayor visited buckley at the bronx home for a discussion of the situation
apparently he believes buckley holds the key to the democratic acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle
in talks with buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx assent to dropping controller lawrence gerosa who lives in the bronx from this ticket
but buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick successor
screvane and beame hailed
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted screvane who lives in queens to replace abe stark the incumbent as the candidate for president of the city council and beame who lives in brooklyn to replace gerosa as the candidate for controller
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx
after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in new york times
the mayor said
it come from me
but as i have said before if i announce my candidacy i will have something definite to say about running mates
a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same
see joe see jim he says
the hand is out
a political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin novel the last hurrah
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in massachusetts public life
day after day some new episode is reported
the state public works department is accused of having spent to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property
an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate
congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers
in the senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition
in the house the coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the bill
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee
it is expected to be reported out tuesday but this is a little uncertain
the action depends on the return of representative james trimble democrat of arkansas who has been siding with speaker sam forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor
trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday
leadership is hopeful
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans
the democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week
the measure which was passed last monday by the senate provides for mortgages at low for families
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy
they are james delaney of queens and thomas of massachusetts
three groups to meet
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of
this would provide for federal loans for construction of parochial and other facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics
delaney and are not willing to vote on the measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps
in the budget that has been submitted for congressional approval would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the stage gordon boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a washington interview
six of these were proposed by religious groups
they will be for teaching agriculture and community development in southeast asia africa the middle east and latin america
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals
there are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled
when he protested the hotel owner said
why do you worry
the government is paying for it
the government pays for all its overseas workers
i work for the government the american said
the hotel owner shrugged
same thing he said
and then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical problem
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state
sargent shriver director of the corps is certain that they can
no religious group he declared in an interview will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes
at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said beaming look he took everything i had
khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker
indonesia is one of the twenty countries of asia africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations
the communist countries allocated more than in economic aid alone last year according to western estimates
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the countries made its modest beginning in
in more than communist technicians were present in those countries
united nations june
a committee of experts has recommended that a population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations
one effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india
india is the most populous united nations member with more than inhabitants
the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report
the report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united nations
formula is due this week
the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week
the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines
each of the members would get two professional posts such as political affairs officer a department head or an economist to start
each member would get one post for each people in its population up to people or a maximum of fifteen posts
each member with a population above would get one additional post for each additional people up to an unspecified point

averell harriman of the united states malcolm macdonald of britain maurice couve de murville foreign minister and howard green minister of external affairs concluded meanwhile a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference
the pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week
princess moune prince souvanna young daughter read the statement
they had a luncheon together in an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation she said

the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days
to deal with principles
the meetings in zurich the statement said would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government

within view of the avenue are some of the united states tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments
of course pennsylvania the white house is the most famous address of the free world
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about high
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about years old
in the early spring of a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch women parade
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote
in the presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time
seats on square
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this most valuable records are kept
also the department of justice building is located where edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground

what does offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the immediate political future
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants ross barnett
barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well
consequently it is uncertain after nearly months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year
could be scramble
some predict the administration will settle down during and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his quest for the office
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the legislative session
if barnett call a special session in it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session
the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year
legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the per diem is not certain and if they start agitating
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat
with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature
relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together
barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary
with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election
now the picture is clouded and even us james eastland and john stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen
the jimmie davis administration appears to face a difficult year in with the theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from per cent to per cent
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an shortage of cash than to segregation
indeed the curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat
the administration could not say why million was needed for a program
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required vote
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy
if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature
actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the losing battle to block token integration
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly
they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle
then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one
but if the administration should find it does not need the million for a program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues
in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor
it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves
the new year might see some either genuine or token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms

helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night
martin who has been in office in washington for months spoke at the annual meeting at the multnomah hotel
he told some persons that the united challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths
we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the soviet union
he cited east germany where after years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added so long as people rebel we must not give up
martin called for patience on the part of americans
the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build he said
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said
individual help best
we have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient the assistant secretary said
economically martin said the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves
private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves
the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a social cost
martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country
the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with civil defense more plans for the schools in event of attack
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow
the board members after hearing the coordination plea from ralph molvar sw maplecrest said they thought they had already been cooperating
chairman richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go
melvin barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district
los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster he said
nobody really expects to evacuate
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following
molvar who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand said we must have faith in somebody on the local level and it be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children
barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work
molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack program
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be done

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the general council of the assemblies of god in session at the memorial coliseum
the council revised in an effort to strengthen the basic beliefs adopted in
the changes unanimously adopted were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible
at the adoption the zimmerman general superintendent commented the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has without compromise stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives
new point added
many changes involved minor editing and clarification
however the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list
the first of beliefs of the denomination now reads
the scriptures both old and new testament are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man the infallible authoritative rule of faith and conduct
the third belief in six points emphasizes the diety of the lord jesus christ and
emphasizes the virgin birth
the sinless life of christ
his substitutionary work on the cross
his bodily resurrection from the dead
and his exaltation to the right hand of god

church loses pace
talking of the rapid population growth upwards of babies born daily with an immigrant entering the united states every minutes he said our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge
in years we have opened churches the brandt said adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every persons
in this light we need churches in illinois where we have
in southern new england we have
we need in rhode island we have none he said
to step up the program the brandt suggested the vision of new assemblies of god churches in the next years
to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods he said
church meets change
the ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour
a capsule view of proposed plans includes
encouraging by every means all existing assemblies of god churches to start new churches
engaging mature experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers
surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers laymen who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project
arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from months as apprentices in churches
judge charles powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in insurance fraud trial
denials were of motions of dismissal continuance mistrial separate trial acquittal striking of testimony and directed verdict
in denying motions for dismissal judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are
attorney dwight schwab in behalf of defendant philip weinstein argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide
proof lack charged
schwab also declared there is no proof of entering a conspiracy to use the mails to defraud to which federal prosecutor lawrence burbank replied
it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy and the mails were then used to carry it out

the orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision this one to the kansas city athletics by a score of to
indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a advantage
siebern hits homer
over the first five frames jack fisher the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the american league pennant held the scoreless while yielding three scattered hits
then dick hyde hurler entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a deadlock
a homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts
house throws wild
with one down in the eighth marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle
catcher frank throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt
then heywood sullivan kansas city catcher singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run
rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser a wild pitch and frank single under shortstop jerry glove into center
the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers
three were doubles brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one
bill kunkel bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before paying customers in miami stadium
the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth
hartman purchased by the from the milwaukee braves last fall allowed no hits in his scoreless appearance and merited the triumph
keegan a gave up the last two safeties over the final three frames escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally
robinson doubles again
in the ninth robinson led off with his second double of the night a blast off the fence feet deep into left
whitey herzog performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring worked keegan for a base on balls

john powell batting for adair fanned after fouling off two pitches and buddy barker up for stepanovich bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the contest
the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding along with robinson the two birds who got a pair of hits doubled to right center moved to third on russ single to right and crossed on wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate
the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out
jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally
jim gentile bounced a hard shot off glove and beat it out for a single and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman head brandt took third and gentile second on the error
then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners
when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple he was cut down in a close play at third tuttle to andy carey
the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this
lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted next toss feet over the scoreboard in right center
carey singled on a ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first
it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit
then throneberry rapped into a fast double play
breeding to adair to gentile setting up homer over the wall in left center

time stands still every time moritz a army signal corps veteran goes into the field
although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick several every saturday in fact out of football
moritz even have a nose guard or hip pads but one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl
because he already has kicked extra points in tries
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to straight before one went astray last saturday night in the slaughter of washington state
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the team

last year when he worked out at halfback all season he get into a single game
this year coach royal told me if work on my he thought he could use me said moritz
so i started practicing on it in spring training
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and as a result he hopes to start practicing field goals this week
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school including one that beat anson in a district game
i kicked about extra points in tries during three years in high school he said and made in a row at one time
i never did miss one in a playoff game i kicked about in the five playoff games my last two years
moritz came to texas in but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury
he missed the season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played minutes in
his statistical record that year when texas won only one game and lost nine was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of yards punted once for yards and caught one pass for yards
he went into the army in march and returned two years later
but he was scholastically ineligible in and merely present last season
place kicking is largely a matter of timing moritz declared
once you get the feel of it not much to it
tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them seem to get the feel
practice helps you to get your timing down
kind of like golf if you swing a club very often your timing gets off
moritz however kicks only about or extra points during each practice session
if you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead he explained
in their first three games the longhorns have had the ball times and scored times or per cent
their total passing yardage in three games on completions in attempts is only yards short of their total passing yardage in when they made on completions in tries
tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season when he netted yards on carries
he now has yards in tries during three games
saxton has made only one appearance this season and that was in the washington state game for four plays he returned the kickoff yards gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a touchdown run before retiring to the bench
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists be ready for oklahoma
last week when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the top four in rushing he said that last long
monday he had four longhorns in the top four
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday but attention quickly turned from victory to next problem rice university
the mustangs play this week
just real happy for the players coach bill meek said of the victory over the air force academy
i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on
it was the first time been ahead this season when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as a good feeling i think on the part of the coaches and the players
we needed it and we got it
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game
nelson played magnificent football meek praised
he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown
he broke that boy air force fullback nick arshinkoff in two and knocked him loose from the football
gannon contributed saving plays on the aerial thrusts in the late stages
one was on a screen pass from the mustang after an incomplete pass into territory
as soon as it started to form gannon spotted it meek said
he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback terry isaacson had time to turn around
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss
the air and the final play was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own and returned yards
he just lay back there and waited for it meek said
he almost brought it back all the way
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice
kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game meek said
be out of action all this week
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland
looking a lot better and able to run meek explained
let him do a lot of running this week but i know if be able to play
the game players saw the air force film monday ran for minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for minutes
work hard tuesday wednesday and thursday meek said and probably will have a good scrimmage friday
work out about an hour on saturday then work monday and tuesday of next week then taper off
smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday
held out of texas drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the loss to texas a m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday baylor worked out in the rain monday mud or no mud
end gene raesz who broke a hand in the game with lsu was back working out with rice monday and john nichols sophomore guard moved back into action after a idleness with an ankle injury
the texas aggies got a day off monday a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night but myers announced that halfback george hargett shaken up in the tech game would not play against trinity saturday
halfback bud priddy slowed for almost a month by a sprained ankle joined workout monday
the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts a triumph over the denver broncos but their visit will be a short one
the texans have two more road games at buffalo and houston before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach hank men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in reckonings
buffalo coach buster ramsey who has become one of the greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two football leaguers reynolds and warren rabb
rabb the former louisiana state field general came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a upset victory over the houston oilers defending league champions
just our luck
buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star jack spikes though he did the while nursing a knee injury
our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game
in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job
the texans won the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only passes
we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack explained stram
they can be going along doing little damage then bang bang they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes the flashy halfback
he was called upon times more than all of the other combined and delivered yards
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson the speedy halfback hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas
a quick touchdown resulted
that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away said stram quipping i think put that play in the book
the early southwest conference football leaders texas arkansas and texas a m made a big dent in the statistics last week
spree against washington state gave the longhorns a total offense of yards rushing and passing a new swc high
arkansas combined yards rushing with yards passing on completions in tosses and a tough defense to whip tcu and a m with a bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since
completing of passes for yards the aggies had a total offense of yards
texas leads in rushing averages yards and passing to but idle baylor has the best defensive record yards per game to
a m has the best defense against passes yards per game
not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use the major leagues have ordered their own tests which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology
rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis
the husky lefthander was in command all the way before an audience of only and countless of television viewers in the denver area
it was third straight victory of the new season and ran the winning streak to four straight
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning
he has given only the one pass in his innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw
the bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in opener and never lagged
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the attack
after al paschal gruonded out jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe
alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left
jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout
the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil glove
nischwitz was working on a when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth
chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and infield roller accounted for the tallies
the bears added their last run in the sixth on double and outfield flies by porter and wert
gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth
despite the weather the game was clicked off in thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play
chico ruiz made a spectacular play on grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base
bingles and bobbles
cliff cook accounted for three of the eight hits
it was the first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark
mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ
among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer patti waggin who is don rudolph when off the stage
lefty wyman carey another denver rookie will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at tuesday night
ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn
dallas may ap
kenny lane of muskegon seventh ranked lightweight had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler here monday night
billy line double which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a victory over the chicago white sox monday
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game a liner to center
he came all the way around on hit before fans
it was second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year
turk lown was tagged with the loss his second against no victories while ray moore won his second game against a single loss
the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny double to left
the white sox had taken a lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon a walk and a sacrifice fly
jim home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a lead but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard
al over left in the fourth his fourth homer of the campaign tied the score and first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front
a double by green an infield single by lemon and solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth
ogden utah may ap
boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball
had it he told a newsman
i know when my reflexes are gone and not going to be any man on the ball club
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout
jensen got only six hits in for a batting average in the first games
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno where his wife former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen awaited
she said when she learned jackie was heading home just speculating but i have to think jack feels hurting chances
the union pacific railroad streamliner city of san francisco stopped in ogden utah for a few minutes
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him
the conductor said to ritchie i think you want to talk to him
probably get a ball bat on the head
mad at the world
but jackie had gone into the station
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand
i told him who i was and he was quite cold
but he warmed up after a while
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a and said anything he liston got was through a keyhole
he said he had never talked to liston
liston is bill liston baseball writer for the boston traveler who quoted jensen as saying
i hit anymore
suddenly my reflexes are gone
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging
and so it was over the weekend what with warren spahn pitching his masterpiece against the giants and the willie mays retaliating with a spree sunday
both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime
of the two cherished achievements the elderly hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the milestone
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish i was and a big leaguer
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the great lefthanders in the history
yes with bob grove carl hubbell herb pennock art nehf vernon gomez et al
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball ball player as they say in the trade
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium before a new record crowd for the period of
spahnie know how to merely go through the motions remarked enos slaughter another guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse
the spectacular mays who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings
incidentally only two did it before a home audience
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in ebbetts field
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies the joe adcock lou gehrig of the yankees pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito then with cleveland made their history on the road
big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether an american or national fan and anti or
the record books however would favor the ace
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as home runs and stole as many as bases
once the figure was
lifetime batting average of is points beyond
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in park
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump
the tv audience was privileged to see four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the top rulers
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the living room athletic club when games were cut off
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy
this year i am told the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy
this dissatisfaction led to request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game
cincinnati ohio ap
the powerful new york yankees won their world series in a romp over outclassed cincinnati crushing the reds in a humiliating barrage monday in the loosely played finale
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries the american league champs still mounted a attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game
johnny blanchard replacement slammed a homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a first inning
hector lopez subbing for berra smashed a homer off bill henry during another explosion in the fourth
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors
the crowd of had only two chances to applaud
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about feet away with two men on
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game trailing only but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out
in the fifth wally post slashed a homer off bud daley but by that time the score was and it really matter
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager
only bucky harris the of washington in and eddie dyer of the louis cardinals in had accomplished the feat
nick skorich the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles was elevated today to head coach
skorich received a contract at a salary believed to be between and a year
he succeeds buck shaw who retired at the end of last season
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of staff jerry williams and charlie gauer
williams is a defensive coach
gauer works with the ends
choice was expected
the selection had been expected
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings the newest national football league entry
van brocklin the quarterback who led the eagles to the title was signed by the vikings last wednesday
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player
with skorich at the helm the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing
in the past the club depended largely on van aerials
skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack split between running and passing
coach played years
skorich who is years old played football at cincinnati university and then had a professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers
an injury forced skorich to quit after the season
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers
the eagles signed him for staff in
skorich began his new job auspiciously today
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth the eagles were honored for winning the championship
shaw and skorich headed a group of players coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football

the shea a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james farley bernard gimbel and clint blume shea worked relentlessly
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees
despite countless barriers and disappointments shea moved forward
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion he sought to convince another national league club to move here
when that failed he enlisted branch aid in the formation of a third major league the continental with new york as the key franchise
the continental league never got off the ground but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand
flushing stadium in works
the new york franchise is headed by charles shipman payson
a municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford frick
efforts figure prominently in the new stadium

arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight

horton smith of detroit a former president of the professional golfers association will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington democrat of missouri
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months
he won the masters the united states open and a record in prize money
he was heralded as sportsman of the year by sports illustrated and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earned for him the hickok belt
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot
a couple of weeks ago he scored a monstrous on a hole
it made him human
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all
it was neither a spirit of nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all
the best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher
he boomed a drive
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance
no margin for error
on the narrow fairway of a hole arnold whipped into his second shot
the ball went off in a majestic arc an slice
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side
it is possible that i he said ruefully
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes
so he wound up with a dozen
it was a nice round figure that he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed
from the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an in the texas open
the idol of the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a in the united states open
their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a gully
partner was long jim barnes who tried to keep count
stickler for rules
how many is that jim
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project
thirteen said long jim
nae man said willie ye must be the echoes
he had a
dozen were honestly earned
nor were there any rules to save him
if there had been he would have found a loophole because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book
this knowledge has come in handy too
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway
the ball floated downstream
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie
arnold sent for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream
i knew it all along confessed arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings
yet he remains the fiercest of competitors
even bull into the rules when he is sure right
how he first won the masters in
it happened on the twelfth hole a
iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force
ruling from on high
i can remove the ball i
asked palmer of an official
no said the official
you must play it where it lies
wrong said arnold a man who knows the rules
do as you say but also play a provisional ball and get a ruling
he scored a for the embedded ball a with the provisional one
the golfing fathers ruled in his favor
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke
until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer was some creature who had nothing in common with the duffers
but after that at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today
other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through saturday concern television rules changes professional hall of fame benefits and constitutional amendments
the owners would like each club in the league to play a series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division
however this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks
pete rozelle the league commissioner pointed out
have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other
nine of the teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an conflict in dates
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies they be misled by the slower start this season
pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat mauch said here the other day
the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year
they have the same men no age problem no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season along with bobby shantz
tonight at the cardinals who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in breaking even with them will get their first shot at world champions
the pirates have a record this year and the redbirds are
change in pitchers
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher from bob gibson to ernie broglio for several reasons record and mark against pittsburgh a year ago
the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible
the disheartening collapse against the phillies sunday
manager hemus eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment
after open date solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night
harvey haddix set back by the flu this season will start against his former cardinal mates who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in game at busch stadium
boyer is suffering from a stiff neck
haddix has a record against the redbirds despite only a mark in
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he decided between mizell and vern law for game
mizell has won both of his starts
nieman kept in lineup
after a lengthy workout yesterday an open date hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record run day against the giants
i have to stay with nieman for a while hemus said
bill white sore ankles should be ready
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh i may use don taussig in center
lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about minutes and he looked good hemus said
he should be getting back in the groove before long
our pitching is much better than it has shown
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday
six bucks over
until the bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend the champions had eight men hitting over
despite the recession pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess gino cimoli bill virdon bob clemente and dick groat each
dick stuart don hoak
and bob skinner
bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs
friend is off to a great start with a record but likely to see action here this week
getting friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good murtaugh said
virdon has been blasting the ball
no plunkers for him
six bucs over
the pirates jumped off to an start by may last year when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season
on last may the cardinals stood at ending a on that milestone
in the birds were on may
a year later they were
since the louis club has been below on may just four times
the team was off to a beginning then fell as low as on may before finishing with victories
the cards were on may but ended with triumphs the top since
then last season the birds tumbled as low as on may before recovering to make a race of it and total victories
since the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the dodger team
those dodgers won their first games and owned a mark and a lead by may
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new giants who dropped of their first
they honored the battling billikens last night
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of louis university players who in the words of coach john benington had more confidence in themselves than i did
the most valuable player award was split three ways among glen mankowski gordon hartweger and tom kieffer
in addition a special award was given to bob bevo nordmann the center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury
you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different
the boys had a tremendous respect for each ability
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do
several times i found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk
be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say worry coach get all right
the trio who shared the honors were introduced by bob broeg sports editor of the
kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his excellent play
mankowski the defensive expert was cited for his performance against bradley in louis nationally televised victory
benington said never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills
after the coach listed all the faults hartweger said coach before i leave here get to like me
benington admired spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said i want to thank wife for talking him into letting me play
bob burnes sports editor of the presented bob nordmann with his award
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time
within a week after the injury suffered in victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament nordmann was sitting on the bench doing what he could to help benington
on the clock given him was the inscription for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball
other lettermen from the team that compiled a record and finished as in the national invitation tournament were art hambric donnell reid bill nordmann dave harris dave luechtefeld and george latinovich
this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future benington pointed out
by winning against bradley kentucky and notre dame on those home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it take a super team to do it
louis university found a way to win a baseball game
larry scherer last night pitched a game said to be the first in billiken baseball history as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college at crystal city

if true that contented cows give more milk why happy ball players produce more base hits
the two top talents of the time mickey mantle and willie mays have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which to be frank about it never have quite reached expectations
and meant as a boost not a knock
mays and mantle both men at have so much ability that baseball men agree never hit the heights
their heights that is
mantle the blond had one sensational season when he batted and also led the american league in home runs and
like the slugger mays the terror of the giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by or for willie
his best years were when he hit with homers and when he belted home runs drove in and stole bases
now apparently happier under new managers mays and mantle the perfect players are behaving as though going to pass those previous peaks
yes we know professionals men paid to play and they care how handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month
the truth is though that men react differently to different treatment
for that matter stan musial is rare possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers reserving his opinions but not his effort
mantle apparent resented casey attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility
the old man was almost too possessive
stengel inherited dimaggio rizzuto but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors from joplin to new york
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him case wanted to be not only the best homerun hitter but also the best bunter and outfielder
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats
inheriting a more mature mantle who now has seen the sights on and off broadway ralph houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on mickey
the major decided that rather than be led the slugger could lead
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far
the opinion continues here that with a schedule pitching spread thin through a league and a most inviting target in los wrigley field mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books babe homers of
four for alvin
day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year
wonderful walloping sunday four home runs served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark
next to leo durocher dark taught mays the most when he was a rookie rushed up to the polo grounds years ago this month to help the giants win a dramatic pennant

those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation social center at larimer
the pert woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo is a civilian with the army
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director
the job also covers a number of other items
mom marr as the more than men at the center call her is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society
her day starts early but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written and during may which is national salvation army week there are plenty schedules to be made or problems to be solved office is always open and the welcome mat is out
marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures
usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men marr explained
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center
and i bum tickets to everything i can she said
become the greatest beggar in the world
in addition to the tickets to the movies sporting events and concerts marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system
marr also has a number of parolees to mother watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society

my husband and i a month ahead of the rush have just finished a motor journey of miles from tucson to new york city
set for influx
i can testify that motels service and comfort stations they go together like scots and heather dog wagons roadside restaurants souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting

maybe the biggest industry but it certainly looks that way from the highway

there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock as i discovered

many with pools
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools swim at your own risk is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by per cent through salary cuts and effective at next saturday
the current monthly payroll comes to about
howard simpson the president said a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the operates
salary cut and
it will be accomplished in two ways
a flat reduction of per cent in the salary of all officers supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions
there are about officers and employees in this class
sufficient of union employees to bring about a per cent cut in the union payroll expense
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough a spokesman said
those union members kept on their jobs therefore will not take a cut in their wages
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job

the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what
the proposal was made by david jenkins after he and ellwood williams a board member and critic of the superintendent argued for about fifteen minutes at this meeting
the disagreement was over what jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting
williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of conversation and how they were written up for the approval
i hate to have these things come up again and again jenkins commented as he made his suggestion
these are the minutes
write what you tell me to
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago
it was about that time a board member said later that thomas pullen state superintendent of schools told jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him
the board of county commissioners the sanitary commission the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings
jenkins notes however that most of the school boards in the state do not do so

the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are deficiencies in the snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible
councilman william schaefer fifth said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december
equipment should be in operation almost immediately after the first snowfall schaefer said
the councilman who is the administration floor leader also criticized bernard werner public works director for halting snow operations on tuesday night after the sunday storm
sent home for rest
werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week
what he did werner said was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest
work resumed wednesday he said
schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them should be strictly enforced
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive
recounting personal observations of clearance work the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes

nonresidential at down per cent

residential building consists of houses apartments hotels dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter
the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments which began about six years ago has more than tripled within that span of time
in it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly per cent of the starts in residential construction
while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the field
although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments leo pantas vice president of a hardware manufacturing company pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house
convenience held key
convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today
quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in pantas predicted
living units are being added to the harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section
ultimately the development will comprise units in and structures
various of the apartments are of the terrace type being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct
others which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs have balconies
the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction
heating is by individual forced warm air systems
construction in will account for about per cent of the gross national product according to a study by corporation
vital secrets of first atomic submarine the dreadnought and by implication of the entire united states nuclear sub fleet were stolen by a soviet spy ring secret service agents testified today
the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in and was launched last year
it is a killer sub that is a hunter of enemy subs
it has a hull patterned on that of the united states nautilus the first atomic submarine
its power unit however was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack
five held for trial
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow police court here at the end of a three day hearing
a full trial was ordered for
two british civil servants miss ethel gee and her newly devoted friend harry houghton and divorced
they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard
gordon lonsdale a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport
when arrested he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as secrets in christmas gift wrapping it was testified
flashed to moscow
a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger bookseller and wife joyce
in washington the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen an american couple formerly of new york city
in their suburban cottage the crown charges the krogers received secrets from the mystery man usually on the first saturday evening of each month and spent much of the getting the secrets off to moscow either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books
each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing a printed page or a manuscript
all five pleaded innocent
only miss gee asked for bail
her young british lawyer james dunlop pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother her maiden aunt also and bedridden for years and her uncle who once ran a candy shop
refuses to grant bail
i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them said the magistrate baraclough
the trial will be held probably the first week of march in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the was sentenced to years in prison
fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five who may have altered history in the
fuchs after nine and a half years was released being given time off for good behavior
he promptly went to communist east germany
the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five in american and british currency mostly bills and in british government bonds and stocks
this is russian money said mervin for the attorney office
he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow lonsdale the red paymaster and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their secrets
of highest value
the fact that secrets of the dreadnought and thereby of the american undersea fleet were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier
but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare george symonds
he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon
the information he said would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy
just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring watched for six months was broken remained untold
the british defending lawyers who today increased from three to four demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury the chances of their clients would improve
so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour
almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet
britain began designing the ship in but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed
the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack
with the machinery went a complete design for the hull
the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it
much of the future depends upon her an american naval announcement said on the first arrival in british waters in august for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station
it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work
her basic hull form a teardrop and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines including the potent polaris missile submarines the statement went on
the atom reactor water cooled was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric
thru development the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size and also in complexity allowing a single propeller to be used the navy said
the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work
it was first tried out on a conventional submarine the albacore in
the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built
reputedly it could outrun underwater the fastest destroyers
it could reputedly go miles without refueling and stay down more than a month
it was of the type designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes
the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss purse would if completed and handed back have given the kremlin a complete picture of our current effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future
interested in detector
the spy ring also was particularly interested in asdic the underwater equipment for detecting submarines it was testified
range was a vital detail
designs of parts were sought
six radiomen told how twice on two days after the ring was nabbed a transmitter near moscow was heard calling using signals times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in apartment and the house and also fastened to the transmitter lid
oddly the calls were still heard days after the five were arrested

no comments by

emory board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the tax laws made such a step possible
emory charter and have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race board chairman henry bowden stated
but an official statement adopted by the emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes
the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated
emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning of true university grade and meet its financial obligations without the privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions the statement said
the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation
an emory spokesman indicated however that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws
the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if among other criteria all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people
at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies but their status never has been challenged by the state
emory is affiliated with the methodist church
some church leaders both clerical and lay have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation
the student newspaper the emory wheel as early as the fall of called for desegregation
from its beginning the statement said friday emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning
teaching research and study according to highest standards under christian influence are paramount in the emory university policy
as a private institution supported by generous individuals emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education
there is not now nor has there ever been in emory charter or any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race color or creed
insofar as its own governing documents are concerned emory university could now consider applications from prospective students and others seeking applications from prospective students and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university irrespective of race color or creed
on the other hand emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia
when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race color or creed continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education

downtown and art theater managers and owners contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request said they had no knowledge of such a letter and that it was not in the friday mail
however three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend
the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday
several theater operators said however that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the affair
student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago
charles black coahr chairman said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on but had failed to show up
he declined to name the three
letters asked for a meeting
failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend the letters said would be considered a sign of indifference
black said coahr hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal
a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits
besides managers of downtown theaters the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead

for a second month in a row multnomah county may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer need the state public welfare commission was told friday
it is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in ga category for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary
william smythe director of field service told the commissioners that multnomah as of had spent out of its budgeted in the category leaving only for the rest of the month
at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month this could mean a shortage of as high as
but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month smythe said
no request for emergency allotment had yet been received however

the commission meeting for the first time with both of its commissioners roy webster of hood river and ennis keizer of north bend approved a contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past
the contract with ray field who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape would renew his present salary of an hour up to a maximum of hours a month
field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes
acting administrator andrew juras said that because of unique position and knowledge in the program the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period
but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles and he said he personally regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past
he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave
salary termed modest
juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government
he also said that the salary in terms of going rates in the field was modest in terms of the responsibility
the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed he said and added long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program
do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract
asked grace peck representative from multnomah county of the commission chairman joseph harvey
my feeling at the moment he said is that we have no alternative irrespective of some of the arguments about him
the continued operation of this program depends on having his service
peck later joined by the lee patterson took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday
a publicity release from oregon physicians service of which harvey is president quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem instead of crippling the agency had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses with the key being improved communications between f a and the commission staff
i rather resent she said you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this
i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people
the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles
harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare

it is like handing a loaded automatic to an and telling him to run out and play he commented
buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target the fire ant
but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop he said
the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming
there have even been serious errors in the forest service whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training he added
the news of their experiments reaches the farmers who forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries buchheister told the delegates
in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying buchheister called for support of the wilderness bill creation of national seashore parks including point reyes
preservation of the wetlands where birds breed
a pesticides act
stronger water pollution control programs and federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil

seventeen years ago today german scientist willy fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber
the world war german bomber rolled down a runway and took off
the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip
this had never been done before
now a man fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for missiles and space division at sunnyvale where he played a key role in the development of the polaris missile
he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in
the first two pilots had crashed he said
i had developed the machines and therefore knew them
it was time to go up myself
fiedler was then technical director of reichenberg project which remained unknown to the allies until after the war
about of the special were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead
the target was allied shipping a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe
the success of the project depended upon flight
squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the automatic guidance mechanism the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude
at feet fiedler signaled release and started the roaring engine then streaked away from beneath the heinkel
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of
it was probably first successful flight in a missile
she flew beautifully said fiedler
there was only one power control a valve to adjust the fuel flow
i had exactly minutes to get down to the test strip
using a steering system that controlled the modified tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage
he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown and banked into the airfield
moments later the skimmed across the landing strip edging closer and closer to a touchdown then in a streamer of dust it landed
fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles
the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water striking below the waterline of individual ships
a crack corps of pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers but the project was halted before the end of the war and the missiles later fell into allied hands
now a family man with three children fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale
his spare time is spent in soaring gliders
so quiet he said so slow serene and so challenging

members of the san francisco american friends service a quaker organization will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at saturday
in a letter to the american friends service schweitzer wrote
leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out
they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack
the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons
otherwise no peace is possible
governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency

greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay to greek victims of nazi persecution it was announced today
probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week
for many reasons the demand to buy shares in the company was tremendous
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell
investors who wanted shares in many cases ended up with and customers who had put in a bid to buy shares found themselves with and counted themselves lucky to get that many
in fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than shares
some dallas investment firms got only shares for all of their customers
a measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of a share
the first trade wednesday afternoon at eppler guerin turner the managing underwriter was at a share
and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around a share
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market
indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up
letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold to the public at with another reserved for morton foods employes at a share
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering
we subscribe shares of morton foods of texas
cable confirmation it said translated
but could not let the swiss bank have even shares
after it allotted shares to underwriters and selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone
but the result of it all was partner dean guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation
i feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do
but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one
the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances
first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up
as a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced at roughly times earnings to yield a little over per cent on the anticipated dividend
second the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks frito and lay on the market
both of those have had dynamic in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast
and third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late
foods which long had been considered recession resistant but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going to higher ratios
the potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger
the history of the potato chip industry is that many of successful companies got started during the deep depression days
those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities to last almost years in the competitive survival of the fittest
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no management in their firms
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito
all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is
now if newest product a corn chip known as turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to

the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn beryl sprinkel economist of harris trust savings bank chicago predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers california group conference
another speaker william draper former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper gaither anderson urged the to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we be pushed around any more
he urged support for president requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations
not flash in pan
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern
in view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in nor as severe as in late and
sprinkel strongly refuted the current thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery
he cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation
the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in
the unsatisfactory expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike
draper declared as i see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today
we must justify our heritage
we must be ready for any needed sacrifice
he said that from his experience of two years with clay in west berlin administration that russia respects our show of strength but that presently not acting as we should and must
he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you buy yourself out and what trying to do
while he declined to suggest how he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro for unless we do liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere
its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i believe we can permit that

a billion advertising budget in an billion economy was envisioned for the here tuesday by peter peterson head of one of the greatest camera firms in a key address before the american marketing
however peterson president of bell howell warned marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and unconventional wisdom
as we look to the billion economy that is predicted for and the increase of about in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed peterson said
with this kind of new product the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically
the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the advantage which it often needs
nothing to fear
peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas
he cited as an example how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs by improving its production and technology
he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an camera in germany with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market

the bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things
but it seems that this electronic brain programmed correctly
this resulted in a great number of errors
and letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders
i visited the bank in march and wrote a story about the situation
at that time the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand
they indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected within days
that period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds complaining about mistakes in their accounts

new york central railroad president alfred perlman said tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the chesapeake ohio and baltimore ohio railroads merge
perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger but could possibly be an ultimate effect
the railroad president made the statement in an interview as the interstate commerce commission opened round of its hearing into the c request to control and then merge with the b aj
all these kind of things weaken us perlman said
board chairman howard simpson of the baltimore ohio railroad testified the b o was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the chesapeake ohio railroad
the financial situation of the baltimore ohio has become precarious much worse than at any time since the depression of the he told the hearing
c o president walter tuohy was summoned back for by new york central attorneys before examiner john bradford who is hearing the complex case

the industry has said was a poor year
starts were down percent from

the reason says the housing center is that the builders invited to the intentions conference are generally among the more successful businessmen and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders
farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for more
we sold only four pickers all last year
gus ehlers competitor of houtz in this farm community says his business since august is running above a year earlier
before then my sales during much of the year had lagged behind by he says
though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas
paradoxically the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output
although the program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since farmers with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently
the higher price supports provided by the new legislation together with rising prices for farm products are pushing up farm income making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery
seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly above last year
in august our dealers sold more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were higher than last year says mark keeler farm equipment vice president of international harvester
for the year to date sales of the farm equipment dealers still lag about behind
two of three report gains
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states two out of three report their sales since august show sizable gains from a year earlier with the increases ranging from to
not all sections are showing an upswing however
the north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry
the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products
more than million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the trucks buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances chemicals and other products
farmers are so eager for new machinery that haggling less over prices than they did a year ago dealers report
farmers as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale says jack martin who sells case tractors and implements in sioux city iowa
this morning we allowed a farmer on the old picker he traded in on a new model
last year we probably would have given him for a comparable machine
martin sold tractors in august
in august of he sold seven
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about below a year ago the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the farm equipment manufacturers
for example farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about above a year earlier keeler reports
tractor production at of toronto in july and august rose to units from in the like period a year earlier says john staiger vice president
with the lower dealer inventories and the demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements
merritt hill ford motor vice president says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers
except for a few months in late and early retail farm equipment sales have trailed levels since the latter part of
the rise in sales last winter was checked when the new feed grain program was adopted
the program resulted in a cutback of around in planted acreage and as a result reduced the immediate need for machines
nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at of the average three points higher than the july estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for
the government also is aiding income prospects
agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers billion in special subsidies and incentive payments well above the record billion of and about double the million of
price support loans may total another billion this year
with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above gross income is estimated at billion billion above record high
net income may reach billion up billion from and the highest since

kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling
the supreme court decision in was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined
the company in figuring its taxable earnings deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products
such depletion allowances in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets
the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground not to the revenue from finished products
a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the impact on returns still under review for companies that make brick and tile products
the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone
president kennedy in signing the relief measure into law stressed he regarded it as an exception
my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries the president said
charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the
the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date purpose amount and other particulars of the contribution
requests for substantiation the service indicated can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return such as tickets to a show
in such an instance revenuers stressed the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested
a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax under federal law on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation
louisiana however collected an income tax on the profits from the sale
the corporation in filing its final federal income return claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense as permitted under tax law
the revenue service disallowed the claim invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was income
the tax court rejected this view
it said the of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations
the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a ruling on the subject
the service has not said what its next step will be
peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency
it provides that the termination payment each cadet is to get after serving a hitch without pay will be spread over both years not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received
the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and kicked back to the advertising manager the tax court ruled
the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager
the court upheld the contention that these kickbacks were not his income though they passed through his hands
the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved commenting it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction
a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel
the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal excise tax on appliances
hiring the wife for company may win her retirement income
a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls for example may be entitled to distributions under the pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage
she would be taxed on the pensions when received of course but the contributions would be
a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement experts warn is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income
in that event they note the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law
possible upshots the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made
state briefs voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional sales tax within that area
colorado has a sales tax
denver itself collects a sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax
the washington state supreme court ruled that the occupation tax applied to sales made at cost to an oil company by a subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent
the occupation tax is computed on gross sales
the court held that the tax applied to sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities
consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months the government reported
the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under billion in april down from the march level of more than billion
april sales also were below those of april last year when volume reached a record for any month billion see chart on page one
the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april this year two weeks earlier than in and buying was pushed into march
commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march
adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep from those of the month before which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of billion

back in college handsome gander was the only male member of a texas tech class on food
the pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy
last october he gave a public speech in washington entitled are women here to stay
so you can see that gerald ramsey director of food services is not the ordinary type of craven chef
he is apt to rear back and claim his rights
ramsey as food wrangler buys enough groceries to serve meals a week
tell that to the little wife when she moans at the burden
he also dishes up snacks
and he operates three cafeterias in the student center along with mcelvaney dining hall and the tables

and notice that in both places there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line
what does he feed his smu football mastodons at the training table
mostly meat and potatoes they have to have that without getting too fat says ramsey
so he hides the mayonnaise
and to keep stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress he bans all highly flavored condiments
what do the pretty smu girls like on their plates
pretty much hamburger hotdogs steak and at night maybe pizza says the handsome food expert
unfortunately there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower

bake slowly at least hour longer
while this is baking saute mushrooms fresh or canned in butter
sprinkle over top of chicken breasts
serve each breast on a thin slice of ham and sprinkle with thompson seedless grapes
leave off the ham and you call it chicken pontiac says ramsey
contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor modern but has sculptured pattern many design facets warmth dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability
that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month
though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the and two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated but warm look in contemporary
these two heritage and drexel chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece but a collection of correlated designs each of which could stand alone
the heritage collection to be shown by and studio has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time
called perennian to indicate its lasting good today and tomorrow quality the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces
walnut wormy chestnut pecan three varieties of burl philippine cane ceramic tiles marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors brick or paneled walls windows that bring in the outdoors
it is a collection with a look offering simplicity with warmth variety and vitality
the drexel collection called composite to be shown by offers a realistic approach to decorating a mature modern that is a variation of many designs
rounded posts give a soft sculptured look paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia
a buffet provides serving a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end recessed arched panels decorate a long chest
an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented with a young basic functional group of chests dressers and corner units and a canted headboard
the other bedroom has heavier styling dressers with acacia panels a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror
colorful bright eastman chromspun fabrics with the magenta pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles
design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote fall group composite
the pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top
design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor
to bring warmth to the dining area golden orange tones are used in the fabrics
dignity and comfort in a contemporary manner reflecting the best aspects of design with substance and maturity keynote the perennian collection from heritage
center panel wood actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases

a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today
what most people seem to realize if they tied up with the thing as i am is that of the problem is transportation
i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school
it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to at the grammar school
getting to and from school was no problem
they either walked or were driven
now they go to a high school that is two miles away
one might think the problem would be similar
they could walk ride on a bus or be driven
much more complex than that
generally they go to school with a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car
this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails a certain loss of social status
a young man like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who even in a higher class than he is and is also a girl
why you walk to school then
my father walked through two miles of snow in illinois
i was asked
no i said i happen to grow up in illinois
i explained however that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom
i had to ride a streetcar two miles
sometimes the streetcar was late
sometimes there even any seats
i had to stand up with the ladies
sometimes i got on the wrong car and get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there
tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car
she has to have at least one car herself
i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman
even that satisfactory
if they have to take any car rather take the big one
they say that when they take a car gloriana take her car but rides with them
but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car big enough
the logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself
the solution naturally is the bus
however a walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and too hard on my legs
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there
but hardly realistic
nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman and already got an education

an idea for a room that is easy to execute and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than put away in boxes
displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent
to create such a lamp order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the head
make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted l the foot of the l about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light
using the strings that manipulate the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base
in this way you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on the pedestal
if the puppets are of uniform size you can change them in accord with your whims
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a playtime
those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a
the scalloped edge is particularly appealing
trend toward furniture designs from past is teaching and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era
a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions
in the background lurked the feeling however that these pieces beautiful as they were lacked the utilitarian touch
so bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the hard knocks while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only
this true of the many homemakers of the according to decorator consultant leland alden
housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs says alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had an innate sense of the practical
there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop down to earth designs or go out of business
hotel bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction the versatile kings plus two
this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while a well integrated fast moving outfit specializing in skits vocals comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch
show spotlights the kings george worth bill kay frank ciciulla and gene wilson flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine and the beat is solid
in the comedy division the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props
net result is some nonsense part of which can be classed as pure slapstick
kings have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs

newcomers are ernie kemm on piano wes robbins bass and trumpet and jack kelly on drums
a solid show but except for some interim keyboarding by ernie all the way

is there anything a frustrated individual can do about growing threat on our doorstep and around the world
more than teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from to sunday at first presbyterian church
at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged
a young real estate salesman kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing
kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism but never felt there was anything he as an individual could do about it
when he attended the christian crusade school here about six months ago jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it
the best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church
and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote a biblically strong christianity
so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than top teenagers and adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the program
this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation
a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami
and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism during high school and college days by ted place director of greater miami youth for christ and jon braun director of campus crusade for christ
the second half of the film communism on the map and the movie operation abolition also will be shown
response to the program has been so encouraging kern said that a youth school at dade county auditorium may be set up soon
and to encourage other churches to try their own programs kern said this sessions including the free dinner will be open to anyone who makes reservations
the need for and the way to achieve a christian home will be stressed in special services marking national christian family week in miami area churches next week

it will be the second time the assistant manager of a coral gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the ceremonies for families with new babies
the first one two years ago changed the routine of their home life
when you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the christian faith you strive a little harder to uphold those vows explains the slender vice president of the young couples sunday school class
until that first dedication service he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home
they have five daughters coral lee glenda rae pamela karen and shari five months
but after that service they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table have bedtime prayers and bible stories
to their surprise the children all were eager and quite able to take part
even the feels miffed if the family has a without her

the leningrad kirov ballet which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house is i think the finest classical ballet company i have ever seen and the production of the sleeping beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing
this work is no favorite of mine
i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the utterly captivating presentation
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in ova eva or aya
in other words no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests miss omsk miss pinsk miss stalingr oops skip it
these qualities alone however would not account for their success and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this collective personality
it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet
that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety is totally absent from the kirov
this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics
but obviously at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned
irina kolpakova the princess aurora of performance would be a change for the better anywhere at any time no matter who had had the role before
she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on and her dancing has a feminine suavity lightness sparkle and refinement which are simply incomparable
alla sizova who seems to have made a special hit in the east was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner yuri soloviev was wonderfully virile acrobatic and poetic all at the same time in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky
vladilen semenov a fine danseur noble
konstantin shatilov a great character dancer
and inna zubkovskaya an excellent lilac fairy were other outstanding members of the cast but every member of the cast was magnificent
the production designed by simon virsaladze was completely traditional but traditional in the right way
it was done with great taste was big and spacious sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes but sumptuous in a muted style with rich quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery
evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra one containing excellent soloists the violin solos by the concertmaster guy lumia were especially fine but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity
mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society

for a good many seasons been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies
after all this movies are next television shows
so i went to see la dolce vita
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality
all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this film
if all the romans did a surprise to me that rome fell
after television la dolce vita seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night
i cannot imagine a single scene that done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week
i believe tv watchers will be bored
la dolce vita has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western
week in week out there is more sex to be seen in the adventures of ozzie and harriet
there is more decadence on sunset strip
there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any series
in another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns
with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as find on the robert herridge theater
most of the emphasis has been placed on a wild party at a seaside villa
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties
the dolce vita boasted a strip tease carried as far as a black slip
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face
a frigid beauty and three silly fairies
put them all together and they spell out the only word i can think of dull
apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining
as a moral shocker it is a dud
but this detract from its merit as an interesting if not great film
the paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly
this is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories
and when they sell it to television in a couple of years it can be shown without editing

the week went along briskly enough
i bought a new little foreign bomb
it is a british bomb
very austere yet racy
it is very chic to drive foreign cars
with a foreign car you must wear a cap it has a leather band in the back
you must also wear a car coat
the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive
but we really get along without it
where do you put the lighter fluid ha ha
asked the gas station man
the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor
gas station people are very debonair about small cars
when i drove a car with tail fins i had plenty status at the oases
my car gulped gallons without even wiping its mouth
this excellent foreign bomb takes only six
when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome the gas people were happy to see me
check the oil and water sir
they polished the windshield
they had a loving touch
the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank
what kind of car is it
he asked gloomily
it is a british austin the smallest they make
get much mileage
the gas station man sighed unhappily
what i always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that
crunch all she wrote
i will die rich
that will be said the gas station man
the windshield looks pretty clean
ah the friends of yesteryear
when i wheeled about finned fore and aft i was the darling of the doormen
dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely
with a small bomb i tuck it between cadillacs
the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself
high blood pressure can get the best of any of us
at last the white house is going to get some furniture by that master american craftsman duncan phyfe whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the presidents of the century sent abroad for their furnishings
the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive library
the suite has been in the same family since the early
the gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey whose famous estate tranquility was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover
authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set years ago
this acquisition is a matched perfect set consisting of two sofas six feet long plus six sidechairs and two armchairs
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home
it is the intention to create in the library a miniature museum of americana before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall
the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture
the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in
the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace
it will be painted to match the paneling in the room
the aid chairman in charge of the redecoration henry francis lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project
committee associates announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york include allen lehman mccluskey and stephen jussel both wellknown manhattan decorators
regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank barnes of boston
president kennedy stay away from his desk for the young concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard
but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music
at the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians students from the ages of to who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp and to greet the crippled cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert
it was the first in the series of concerts for young people by young people to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house
she was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience
she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port and in his welcoming remarks the president said he was representing her
as he approached the open bandstand erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion the band struck up the star spangled banner and followed it with hail to the chief
i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band and we are grateful to them president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl
after paying tribute to the conductor and his youthful students president kennedy said as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music
he added i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field
displaying his knowledge of music the new president remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont by young americans and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the united states
this is a great national cultural asset and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me representing as i do today my wife to welcome all of you here today at the white house
as he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests
he expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde patricia holbrook of mount rainier had attended the joseph kennedy school for the handicapped in boston
the nuns there do a wonderful work the president commented
patricia now attends the melvin sharpe health school in the district
each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon
they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff
many of the members of the staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience
and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected
henry hall wilson a student at the music camp years ago and now on the staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives turned guest conductor for a sousa march the stars and stripes forever
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that social secretary letitia baldrige told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring
he said he contacted a friend henry hall wilson on the staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series
a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the north carolina group to play the first concert
one of the most interested students on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house was letitia baldrige social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy
i was an art major in college miss baldrige explained
been here so many times i count them
she turned out to be a fan too of margaret bouton the associate curator of education
miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at
the brevard group of arrived at the gallery at remaining for about minutes
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later
they decided that they thought made him look sad
they noticed roman buildings in the background of alba madonna and texture in a monet painting of rheims cathedral
everybody had heard of van gogh the french impressionist
gallery director john walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them
he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery is the only museum in the country to have a music director richard bales
sure heard of him and his record the confederacy
along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the guards
in minutes the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late century
a few of them said they preferred contemporary art
among the other artists whose paintings were discussed were boucher courbet fra angelico
the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the rotunda fountain because on the second floor
that imposing somewhat austere and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at took on bustling life yesterday
more than scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader albert pike who headed the scottish rite from to
they came together in the huge council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized
wheeler barnes of denver head of the scottish rite in colorado praised pike as a historian author poet journalist lawyer jurist soldier and musician who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order

the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years
john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous
he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged in no frame of mind to play with their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife
hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often that he help around the house and that he really care about the family
she accused him of ignoring her
he in turn told her she demanded too much
they were both discouraged disgusted and miserable
mary decided she had had enough
without any definite plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done
the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer
family service sharing in ugf has five agencies in the washington area
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems
because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up and black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia the agency nearest them
for nearly a year they have been receiving counseling separately and together in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other
they are now working together toward solving their difficulties
john received a promotion in his firm
he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life
mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings and the is frequently preceeded by a session of happy family
to outsiders the blacks seem to be an ordinary happy family and they are but with a difference
they know the value of being just that an ordinary happy family
family service has helped hundreds of families in this area
perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital
but to the families it serves their help cannot be measured

anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze
for crucial encounter
one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev
hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground
the president knew that a confrontation with khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable
but he was convinced that the realities of power military economic and ideological were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting
he wanted to buy time to strengthen the and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy
last friday the white house announced
president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita khrushchev in vienna june and
the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in relations
the heightened tension in fact had been a major factor in the change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader
he was not going to vienna to negotiate the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned
but kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting
despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war
road to vienna
the and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nations
the first time was in when a big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva
the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east
in president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the
that meeting produced the spirit of camp david a spirit it later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement
on the third occasion another big four summit session at paris a year ago there was no problem of an illusory spirit
premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the for the incident
the episode tended to confirm the belief that propaganda the hope of concessions and the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were the soviet real aims in summitry
thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem
shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words
as long as khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations
the president had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance
he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary
he wanted time too to review the united global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating
above all he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier doorstep
at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader
ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels
but kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war to try to probe intentions and to make clear his own views
moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions
both elements the caution about a meeting the willingness eventually to hold one were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn thompson brought back to russia late in february
the letter dated was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march
it dealt mainly with a broad range of issues
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted
developments over the next two months however caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly
deadlock on tests
the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva
the deadlock has been caused by the new demand for a east west and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery
in the strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing
kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament
there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly to communist china
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent
moreover moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the secretariat and the international control commission for laos
kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible
developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting
initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting
at the same time there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the ability and determination to resist communist pressure
in cuba the had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep
in laos the picture was almost equally bad
willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on soviet terms
beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention in laos despite warnings that they might do so allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the forces
as a result the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure
in the light of those events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet mood was cocky and aggressive
he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out
the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back
it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may made new inquiries through the embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future
kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may after consultation with the allies
the response from london paris and bonn was favorable
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week
apparently at the insistence of the the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting
the washington announcement said
the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries
the meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries
the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned veteran of the cold war who in own words is shrewd tough vigorous and confident and a president his birthday is may with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the of both approval and disapproval
the approval did not arise from an expectation of agreements at vienna
the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations
but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary
khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men
the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by kennedy would give him pause
apart from the personal equation another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway
this time the initiative came in part at least from washington
other allies consulted
there was also the fact that by the time he meets khrushchev the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity
finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord
there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world
if tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union
disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse
after cuba and laos it was argued khrushchev will interpret the consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness perhaps even panic and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds
moreover the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of firm foreign policy commitments
the question was raised for example as to what attitude the president would take if khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east
there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory
mollusks are a case in point
the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development
though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education
there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that
by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence
there is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university
but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy
official encouragement is one thing but the test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds
american catholics have responded generously to and appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning
they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility
all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise
yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities
community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible
to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community
it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension
the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship
american catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious communities
had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees
there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business
this spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement
it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas
i think for example of three colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university which is also
this is not an isolated example
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough
it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot
apart however from the question of wasteful duplication there is another aspect of the family business spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence
at the earlier excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conducted on an community basis
but with demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for outsiders becomes more pressing
the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for
commenting on the earlier stage the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative noted that the term as opposed to maintenance employee was a not inapt description
today however the outsider is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement
in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it even with the best of intentions he the president of the university is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which considered as it must be by him in individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying temperament interests and capabilities
it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that phrase the attainment of excellence
the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty
it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of tension
but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one
outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university
in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel
word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences
expressions of even dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype
in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere
to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure
this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated
when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services
a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family
just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions
adequate compensation is indispensable
yet adequate compensation and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification
there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels
the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution
but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation
the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order
the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with titles but no real authority
in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked
competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to conclusions without destroying the illusion that they are making their own decisions
those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by and ersatz decision making
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all
in the notre dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to communication
in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements
john mcclellan of arkansas and david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the laws
once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally
or in the words of anatole france the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of hearings into corruption in relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites
the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program
in addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill
it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike
business week reports that the united aircraft company against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating
the company incurred some million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees hiring and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by the new workers
the company has billed the united states government for of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the business
frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee
the committee remains unresponsive
neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the laws to the unions
the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained
the laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines
it must play a game in which there never is a winner
the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law
hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy
let us look at the industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market
the industry is so structured that by a company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated whether marginal or average pricing is applied
the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price
naturally enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry
uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition
but if they show they get the orders
under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants
the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows
in other words the laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday
the question might be asked the managements of the manufacturers know these facts
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws
the past usefulness of the laws to management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism back in
he wrote the laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure
laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship
when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control
in this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the laws
in any event it is obvious that the laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government
this escape from control has led to evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while
a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license
the penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities
if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle
however one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the laws are effective and rational
quite clearly the laws are neither effective nor rational and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union
those who favor placing trade unions under laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform
before individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english
the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in implicit in the writing of section of the national industrial recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle
the wagner act the act and the act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining
the basic purpose of an effective system is the removal of wages from competition
if a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession
the problem must be faced squarely
if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them
human labor was exactly that a commodity in and america
as early as adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work
but many against combining to raise it
england upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies
in the boston house strike for a day was denounced by the organized employers who declared it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies
there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly
the courts shared the opinion of the employers
in people fisher justice savage of the new york supreme court declared
without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means
compare this statement of a judge with how congressman martin according to the daily labor report of defends the necessity of enacting legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment
senator mcclellan is proposing the application of measures to unions in transportation
his bill allegedly aimed at hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international
paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the act to labor in transportation the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the act
indeed it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the laws
for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers
at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates
the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies
it was most effective against trade unions
in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer
the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment
in the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity
the law could not suspend economics
labor remained a commodity but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the laws
the courts by interpretation emasculated the act
in the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company
the company sued under the laws alleging that the activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce
what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise
the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce
at a session on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on affairs abroad
afterward democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen
what herter presented said gore was not a very encouraging review
that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts
while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the with a blunt and drastic demand within hours the had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons the embassy staff alone totaled citizens plus cuban employees
president eisenhower held an meeting with top military and advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately
there is a limit to what the united states in can endure said the president
that limit has now been reached
through secretary herter ike offered kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision
kennedy through of state dean rusk declined
he thus kept his hands free for any action after although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the and latin america see the hemisphere
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam
in view of the present situation in laos said the announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific
cutting short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines
on the island base of okinawa task force made up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move southward on signal
but by end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration see foreign news and the was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist rather than a government might be best for laos
there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other fronts
political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war and they were probably right
it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again said one military man
but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground
at geneva in to get the war in settled the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet nam which then predictably became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos
the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west
he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj
the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia
russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian arms drops in laos using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time
soviet premier khrushchev sent new hopes for peace to kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply
considering the state of the whole world the cold three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous
but in senator words it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront john kennedy on inauguration day
turmoil in the house
as the congress began its sessions last week liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor
the liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group had fought the committee before and had always lost
this time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable
they had the unspoken support of kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck
and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will
there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee to pack it with additional liberals and break the deadlock or to remove one of the conservatives namely william meyers colmer pronounced calmer
caucusing the liberals decided to go after colmer which actually was the more drastic course since seniority in the house is next to godliness
a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than his years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative
he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents
he is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an speech
for years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee
there his vote along with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge and the four republican members could and often did produce a deadlock that blocked welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes
there was sufficient pretext to demand ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the electors in mississippi
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons
in the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their rebellion against harry truman and in after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage
in the heat of the drive last week judge smith threatened reprisal against powell
said he we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here
but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee and that he was the only man who could do anything effective
in a tense session with judge smith rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee two democrats including one southerner and one republican
smith flatly rejected the offer and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels
the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he is said to regard as an inferior man
news of commitment soon leaked out
when clarence cannon got the word he turned purple
he shouted and rushed off to the room to object a dangerous precedent
cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the forces as chairman of the appropriations committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal projects
sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally carl vinson chairman of the armed services committee
threat of war
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose
his highest count of supporters numbered and he needed nearly twice that number to control the democratic caucus
the liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes in the democratic committee on committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the house before they could oust colmer
one big question if colmer was to be purged what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors
in all three arenas they seemed certain of victory especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash
but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party
with that possibility in mind wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of compromise
here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader
one wants a little more power and the other want to give up any
battle in the senate
the senate launched the congress with its own version of an ancient battle but in contrast with the guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol speech
question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate and thereby cut off filibusters
a bipartisan force from democratic hubert humphrey to republican leverett saltonstall was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills
new clint anderson offered a resolution to change the notorious rule to allow of the senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current
fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators
dick russell objected politely and the battle was joined
privately the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage
privately they also admitted that their hopes for clint modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon
in nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding
armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week
hopefully the perennial battle of rule then would be fought to a settlement once and for all
since election day vice president richard nixon had virtually retired by his own wish from public view
but with the convening of the new congress he was the public man again presiding over the senate until john inauguration
one day last week nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight presidential election
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration
this is the first time in years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated he said
the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves
gary player the small trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap
arnold palmer the defending champion lost his title on the hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief
just when you think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament
and that is just what happened on the last few holes
the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer
player was the first to feel its teeth
after playing a splendid first nine holes in two strokes under par on this fifth and final day of the tournament fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed game rapidly fell to pieces
he bogeyed the
after a journey through woods and stream he the
he bogeyed the by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a and a total of
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course player was almost in tears
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer by then playing the hole was leading him by a stroke
palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes
now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the hole he seemed to have the championship won
but the shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower
afterwards palmer told charlie coe his partner that he simply played the hole too fast
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by feet
palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt
for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro but it was barely good enough for a tie with coe
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight
end at seven
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters four last year and three this without ever being out of first place
as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of and
his total of was three strokes better than the next best score a by bill collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long
but palmer knew as did everybody else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken
half an hour after he finished his round player holed out at the green with a and a total of four strokes ahead of palmer
more than a streak had ended
long after the erratic climate and the final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes the masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player
unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case
when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge towering prestige
as if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments
player won only one
but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere
on the final round at pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it
but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour
player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer
he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous to
thereafter until the masters player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami
when they reached augusta last week together they had won five of the tournaments to date
on thursday the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and player developed instantly
it was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course
the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences
got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg
but player was only one stroke back with a
even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever that this tournament was to be essentially a match between palmer and player
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a
or ken venturi who had a somewhat shaky but was bound to do better
or rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of treacheries
or even old byron nelson whose excellent made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf
on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe
on friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus
rosburg had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were on the course separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a was not having a good day
as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender
player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the
on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament
he birdied the the and the five birdies one bogey and pars for a
starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle palmer birdied the the the and the four birdies one bogey and pars for a
the roar of gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of gallery for a similar triumph
at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a putt on the a thunderous cheer from the direction of the green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole
without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had palmer proceeded to sink his and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply
the boldness of champions
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course
it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence
the bad luck that can so often mar a round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions
bob jones played that way
byron nelson did hogan did
and last week at the masters palmer and player did
as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead
this day palmer had started first
as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was under par for the day
player immediately proceeded to follow suit
in fact he went on to birdie the and as well to go under par for the first eight holes
but real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring yards
he hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating the and first fairways
having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than yards out
player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the fairway and settling for a bogey or gambling
the latter involved hitting a full out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered green
i was hitting the ball well player said later and i felt strong
when playing like that better attack
player attacked with his and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget
it struck the green on the fly and stopped just off the edge
from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par
palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles
they started on the hole a
on this day the wind had switched from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days
at the tee palmer chose to hit a when a was the proper club so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green
his bogey on this hole and subsequent bogeys at and along with a birdie at brought him back to even par
starting the second nine palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it
when mickey charles mantle the new york man of muscle drives a home run feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime
when roger eugene maris muscular teammate powers four home runs in a his performance merits awe
but when tiny albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained the other team thought no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months three more than his total in and his achievement borders on the ridiculous
this is baseball
this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous
it is the year when amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive home runs
willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game
the milwaukee braves tied a record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them
and catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the pitch is now illegal
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion
whatever the reasons not in years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records division
of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy
this of course is most remarkable mark the home runs hit in by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete george herman babe ruth of the yankees
since fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe record and each in turn has been thwarted
what ultimately frustrated every challenger was amazing september surge
in the final month of the season he hit seventeen home runs a closing spurt never matched
always in the abortive attacks upon record one man alone a jimmy foxx in or a hank greenberg in or a hack wilson in made the bid
but now for the first time since lou gehrig with home runs spurred ruth on in two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on
their names are mantle and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real
after games in ruth had home runs
after games in mickey mantle has roger maris
extend and present paces over the full schedule of games and mathematically each will hit more than home runs
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them
to better mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish
all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september and he will establish a new record
in day and until this year the schedule was games
baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that record will remain official unless it is broken in games
even on the basis of games this is the ideal situation insists hank greenberg now of the chicago white sox
it has to be easier with two of them
how can you walk maris to get to mantle
neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict home runs for himself
although both concede they would like to hit they stick primarily to the baseball standard quote the important thing is to win the pennant
but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle the american most valuable player in and and maris the mvp in
each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs i hope roger hits mantle says and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs and i hope i hit
the sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer in dallas in kansas city they are rooming together
mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york international airport
the three pay a month for four rooms kitchen dining room living room and bedroom with and new modern furniture
mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom
maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room
they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking breakfast and sandwich snacks with dinner out mantle supplies the transportation a white oldsmobile convertible and maris drives the course from the apartment house to yankee stadium
mantle maris and cerv probably share one record already among them they have fifteen children eight for cerv four for mantle and three for maris
as roommates teammates and mates mantle who broke in with the yankees ten years ago and maris who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds
both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball mantle in commerce maris in fargo
as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma sometimes in the minors maris recalls i wished i had gone to oklahoma
to an extent the two even look alike
both have blue eyes and short blond hair
both are feet tall and weigh between and pounds but mantle incredibly muscular he has a neck looks bigger
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order
maris purchases suits from in new york
mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at in dallas and pays as much as each
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry tropic of cancer
mantle so appreciated delicate literary style that he broadened minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips
mantle is not normally given to public speaking or for that matter to private speaking
what do you and mickey talk about at home
a reporter asked maris recently
to tell you the truth maris said mickey talk much
this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer
what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative
of the two mantle is by nature the less outgoing maris the more outspoken
but last week when a reporter was standing near locker mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote
see that kid
he said pointing to a boy
never forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game
i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says you stunk
maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen
when made a dumb play he says i want to talk to anyone
by his own confession maris is an angry young man
benched at tulsa in he told manager dutch meyer i play for you
send me where i can play
meyer sent him to reading
benched at indianapolis in he told manager kerby farrell not learning anything on the bench
farrell did and maris led the team to victory in the little world series
the way i am he says
i tell people what i think
if a good ballplayer got to get mad
give me a team of nine angry men and give you a team of nine gentlemen and beat you nine out of ten times
one good indication of the two personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes
was ted williams
when i was a kid maris told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not
when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice
are you kidding
afraid to talk to a guy you idolize
hero was joe dimaggio
when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman an pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his
but dimaggio never said a word
it crushed mickey
he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him
mantle has kept the vow
among all the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies
neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else
if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for an hour paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would lay ties on a railroad track
if working in a zinc mine which he once did for cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the yankees mantle would work in a zinc mine
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate on baseball
they try to play baseball the best they can
each is a complete ballplayer
mantle beyond any question can do more things well
one of the reasons they get along fine says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both realize mantle is above maris
hitting mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both and maris only
they both possess near classic stances dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings
mantle is considerably better hitting for average
fourth in the league to
for maris so far this year
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues
mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base
both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate batting to first base in seconds faster than any other major leaguer
maris ran the dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio the swift shortstop of the white sox
both are good daring fielders mantle covers more ground
throwing arm is stronger
yet with all their skills the appeal of mantle and maris in comes down to one basic the home run
with this ultimate weapon the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season
american league expansion created inevitably weaker teams
only two teams in each league the yankees and detroit the dodgers and cincinnati are battling for first place
appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at lowest moment
in as the startling news that the white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball
something was needed to revive interest
the something was the home run

david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh
there the name vaguely connotes wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art
last week in the german city of dusseldorf david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause
on display were paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection and every single one of them was up for sale
like late albert barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public time thompson at is something of a legend in his own lifetime
he made his fortune during world war when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom
even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings
he gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best
he was able to smell a bargain and a masterpiece a continent away and the museum of modern alfred barr said of him i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson know about
he might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting
he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough
he bought up cezannes braques matisses legers a splendid picasso series more than giacometti sculptures
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world
all these he hung in his burglarproof home called throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them
two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city
but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum
pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years
he went then to a basel art dealer named ernst beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures
last year beyeler arranged to sell worth of klees to the state of north which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built
last week most of the other prizes once offered to pittsburgh went on the block
at the opening of the dusseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time
in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them
some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town
thompson himself said i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures
break in georgia
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color
but in all its years not a single negro student has entered its classrooms
last week federal district judge william bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified negro boy and girl
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in georgia and in alabama mississippi and south carolina as well
for months hamilton holmes and charlayne hunter had tried to get into the university
they graduated together from turner high school where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins
holmes went to morehouse negro college where he is a b student and star halfback
charlayne studied journalism at wayne state university
last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court judge bootle ordered them to apply again
charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state
but holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation
holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse
no said he but officials still called him evasive
they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested
their reason holmes once paid a speeding fine had his license suspended
negro lawyers dug into the records of white students found that many were hardly interviewed at all and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes
the real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school
judge decision the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color
the state will appeal but few think it will actually try to close the university
surprised and pleased students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week
catch for chicago
when the university of chancellor lawrence kimpton submitted his resignation last march a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway
out went letters to old grads asking for suggestions
such academic statesmen as james conant were consulted
two committees pondered possible kimpton successors including adlai stevenson richard nixon and dean mcgeorge bundy
the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather as trustee chairman glen lloyd put it a top scholar in his own right a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago
last week chicago happily found its top scholar in acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle who shared the nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry time cover july
it fell to chancellor kimpton now a standard oil indiana executive to spend his reign tidying up chicago after the typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins
he threw out some of more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to nearly doubled endowment to million
but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era
at caltech geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the famous biology division since
but he has shown a ability to spot recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and
beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters
he avidly reads the wall street journal and took delight in driving a model a ford for years then selling it for
a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away
the man was king leopold of the belgians who in concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good
by force he took under his protection or stole square miles of wilderness in central africa
this is an area nearly as large as western europe
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity
its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings
they were determined by the points at which explorers and gunmen got tired of walking
the population of the congo is million divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking separate dialects
the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism
the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate
the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done or failed to do in the congo since
at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property
but by its record of brutality had touched the national conscience
the belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism
one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children
the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned only their judgment
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time but when the colony received independence in the congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in was and had until then been treated as an infant
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil
the colony was administered from brussels with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote
the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock
in inside africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the united states government as a heavy partner
had they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion
but they were not
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent
they put much effort into public housing
they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food
but instead of delivering the ration either in actual commodities or in cash at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often
would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry
the belgians also placed great emphasis on education
during the there were as many as schools in the congo
but almost all the schools were primary
the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name
some schools were technical the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many
but they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college
it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science
indeed the belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest
when the congo received its independence in there were among its million people exactly university graduates
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it
in one large oversimplification it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping africa
they lacked time to prepare the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies
the congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant
and in brussels street crowds shouted pas une goutte de sang
not one drop of blood
the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess
it is hard to blame them for this
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless
as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate
there were four principal ones
first there were those congolese among them joseph kasavubu who favored splitting the country into small independent states balkanizing it
second there were those moise tshombe who favored a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states
third there were those notably patrice lumumba who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government
and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up
however the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting
a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration
they had divided the congo into six provinces leopoldville kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings
thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war
the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces
around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations
if internal frictions arose they could be handled by the congolese army the force publique which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians
the president joseph kasavubu seemed an able administrator and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man
hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other
presently the members of the force publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting
terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country
the belgian government decided to act and on july dispatched paratroops to the congo
on july the head of the province of katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country
confusion became chaos
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them
on july the security council with france and great britain abstaining voted the resolution which drew the into the congo
vague in wording it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the to take the necessary steps to provide the congolese government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks
hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the troops sent into the congo were to come from african or at least nonwhite nations certainly not from the russia great britain or france
he quickly called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched troops within hours
ultimately the army in the congo reached a top strength of including about from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden who were the only whites
it took the three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo
the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed efforts
the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems he frequently announced that he wanted the to get out of the congo along with the belgians and appealed to russia for help
however there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist
before appealing to the or to russia he first appealed to the for military help and was rejected
lumumba further complicated the mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under albert kalonji wanted to secede as well
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly
but by the end of the period in october something approaching calm settled on the congo
president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him
lumumba fired kasavubu
control of the government such control as there was and such government as there was passed into the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army
mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at headquarters in new york
the belgians at least officially departed from the congo as well withdrawing all of their uniformed troops
but they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga the seceded province which according to tshombe holds of the mineral wealth of the entire country
from october to february the forces in the congo took little action
there was no directive for it the security resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize it
during the lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo
in february the murder of patrice lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe again stirred the to action
on the council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including the use of force if necessary in the last resort
although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one
it also urged that the eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers
ordered an investigation of death
urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army
the presidency talking and listening
though president john kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser unexpected report from khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of foreign policy last week
high up on the priority list was the thorny question of bizerte
on this issue the president received a detailed report from his ambassador adlai stevenson who had just returned from paris and kennedy asked stevenson to search for a way for both paris and tunis out of the imbroglio
ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend
the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek support
the conversation apparently convinced kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable
through ladgham kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba
and one official said the key question now is which side picks up the phone first
on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the economic and social council which the president himself had originally hoped to attend
main purpose of the meeting to discuss president alliance for progress
and that was not all
in conferences with nationalist dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng kennedy assured chiang emissary that the is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations
chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia
however the president who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the if outer admission comes to a vote
the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid
to africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a mission to the ivory coast
all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs
in effect he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason
from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston as the great boeing flies is a routine five hours and minutes including stopovers at phoenix el paso and san antonio
when continental airlines flight took off at one night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer
the plane put down on schedule at in phoenix
minutes later when it took off for el paso hardly anyone of the crew of six or the other passengers paid any attention to the man and boy who had come aboard
at with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso passenger robert berry a san antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward the cockpit
the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach berry said
i figured he was sick
john salvador a farmer from palm desert was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit
the kid had a automatic like they issue in the army he said
the other fellow had a
salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey
the man put his at the head of byron rickards
to rickards a veteran years in the air it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in again much as it had happened in when peruvian rebels made him land a ford at arequipa
but last pirates like the who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra newsweek wanted to go to havana
tell your company there are four of us here with guns the elder man told rickards
the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message
but he told the skyjackers the carry enough fuel to reach havana
they would have to refuel at el paso
most passengers know what had happened until they got on the ground
jerry mccauley of sacramento one of some twenty air force recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion
the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba mccauley said and like a nut i raised my hand
i thought he was the air force recruiter
what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew
they chose four jack casey who works for continental airlines in houston
fred mullen from mercer island
truman cleveland of augustine
and leonard gilman a former college boxer and veteran of the immigration service border patrol
everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at
they found a large welcoming group el paso policemen border patrol deputies and fbi men who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns
other fbi men talking with the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana
the ground crew which ordinarily fuels a in twenty minutes took fully three hours
still more time was consumed while the pilot at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a douglas aj
actually the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane
they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy who thought at first as did most others that it was four followers of fidel castro who had taken over the
kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone
at one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment
from the luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being cubans were native americans subsequently identified as leon bearden from coolidge and his son cody a junior
the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens
the father by accident or perhaps to show as he said we mean business took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons
at more than three hours after landing the beardens gave an ultimatum
take off or see the hostages killed
the tower cleared the plane for at and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway
several police cars loaded with armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the big jet
the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines
the plane slowed to a halt
ambulances baggage trucks and cars surrounded it
the day wore on
at a ramp was rolled up to the plane
a few minutes later fbi agent francis crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed
while crosby distracted the beardens stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door
so did hostages casey cleveland and mullen
that left only the four crew members crosby and border patrolman gilman all unarmed with the beardens
the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket
gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance
he caught officer eye nodded toward young bearden and i swung my right as hard as i could
simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over
off the airplane at the beardens were held in bail of each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines
bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro and live high in cuba
back home in coolidge his wife mary said i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs
congress more muscle
taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation
the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass to the largest peacetime defense budget in history
with the money all but in hand however the administration indicated that instead of the more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested the armed forces would be increased by only
the as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently
in all the senate signed a check for billion which not only included the extra billion requested the week before by president kennedy but tacked on million more than the president had asked for
the senate on its own decided to provide additional and other bombers for the strategic air command
the house which had passed its smaller appropriation before the urgent call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order
in other areas congressional action last week included
the senate by voice vote and the house by passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign not too unhappily
the senate also voted billion to finance the health welfare and labor activities
debate on the bill with its controversial proposals had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend
white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact
food stew a la mulligatawny
most members of the senate because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they can
but because they are politicians they like to talk as as the lowliest voter
as a result ever since when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food even while they opposed every move that might improve it
over the years enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes the menu has pursued its drab course
individual senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced smelts from michigan crabs from maryland oysters from washington grapefruit from florida
but plain old bean soup served daily since the turn of the century at the insistence of the late fred dubois of idaho made clear to the citizenry that the stomach was in the right place
in a daring stroke the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a maitre
holders of bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes
trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward
higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues
result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative
things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their bonds
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing
that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these bonds
other bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february according to standard average
on balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then
however in the same period bonds as a group have bucked this trend
on these bonds price rises since february easily outnumber price declines
investors however still see an element of risk in the bonds
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page
many of the bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of per cent or very close to that
and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds
that per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds
not much more in fact than the return that is offered on treasury bonds
for investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a yield of per cent is high
it is the equivalent of per cent for an unmarried investor with more than of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than of taxed income
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent period ending in february or march shows what is happening
the report is based on a survey by blyth company investment bankers
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period
and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in and early in as a result of business recession
many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter
indication the trend of turnpike traffic is upward
look for example at the ohio turnpike
traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february as compared with those same months in
then march brought an per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs
as a result the net revenues in the months ending march were per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds
that was up from per cent in the preceding months
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike
operating revenues were off in the first three months of but up for the months ending in march
costs were held down despite a bitter winter
for the year the road earned per cent of its interest costs against per cent in the preceding period
the engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston
some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do
the illinois state toll highway for example was not opened over its entire length until december
in the months ended in february the highway earned enough to cover per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial reserves
in the months ended in february this highway earned per cent of its interest
that improvement is continuing
in the first two months of earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up per cent from early
success for many turnpikes has come hard
traffic frequently has failed to measure up to rosy estimates
in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways
many rate increases already have been put into effect
higher tolls are planned for july on the turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study
progress is being made too in improving access to many turnpikes
the kansas turnpike offers an illustration
net earnings of that road rose from per cent of interest requirements in calendar to per cent in the months ended
further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in with the opening of a new bypass at wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city and kansas city
meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years
for some roads troubles
investors studying the bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals
traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike
if nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in
west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same
these however are exceptions
the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement
going to take time for investors to learn how many of the bonds will pay out in full
already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins
many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the point
a top american official after a look at factories thinks the is in a very serious situation competitively
commerce secretary luther hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on may toured plants of two of biggest companies fiat the auto producer and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines
our staff man cabled from turin as follows
follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this
one modern equipment much of it supplied under the marshall plan enables fiat to turn out cars a day
about half of these are exported
two wage costs are a fraction of the costs
a skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns a week
three labor troubles are infrequent
fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years
said secretary hodges a tough combination for the to face
olivetti had a special interest for hodges
olivetti took over underwood the typewriter maker in late
within a year without reducing wages production costs were cut one third prices were slashed
the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled
the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout modern machinery
the firm is
hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the
the inflow of foreign capital would help the balance of payments
hodges predicted i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these
an international conference of the big and countries will be called shortly by president kennedy
chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting
the will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the countries over the years
point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet
if they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible
at the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain countries to control textile exports especially dumping of specific products to countries
japan since has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the
hong kong india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact
none of these countries is happy with these arrangements
the japanese want to increase exports to the while they have been curbing shipments they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big market
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly
the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons
the kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the countries in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas
gradual controlled expansion of the textile trade is what president kennedy wants
this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products
an important clue to washington thinking
note too that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the textile industry
get competitive or get out
in veiled terms what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry
the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization seem feasible
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed
government research will look into new products and methods
import quotas ruled out where the national interest is involved
but the kennedy administration favor import quotas
rather they are impressed with the british success in forcing and helping the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products
happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from countries
among the workers in the world are coal miners
yet coal is cheap enough to make foreign mouths water
steel company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets
virginia coal delivered by ship in wales will be about a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines
coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight
many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting narrow and very deep
productivity of miners is twice that of the british
welsh coal miners are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal
they threaten to strike
the british government will have to decide whether to let coal in
the british coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it sell
every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically sorry but we have that book
there be much demand for it afraid
behind this reply and its many variations is the budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest
what to buy out of the grist of nearly book titles
what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small
most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed annually which includes the salary and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs this in the richest city
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse
confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds
in some parts of the country however a movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a or regional basis
new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow
because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new york offers a of how the plan works
at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system in a area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve
both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state
it was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in to establish fully the thriving systems of today
under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts
an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit
some library boards are wary of the plan
a large library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board
within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved
the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system
all services are given without cost to members
so obvious are these advantages that nearly per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a
to set up a library system the law requires a central book collection of nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it
the collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection
each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency
the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars
in nassau county for example the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since
this system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area
the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford
nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of volumes by
the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers
basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries
on microfilm headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in to the present day as well as bound volumes of important periodicals
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans
headquarters gets about requests every day
it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide
the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries
each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon
east meadow has philosophy psychology and religion
freeport houses social science pure science and language
history biography and education are centered in hempstead
levittown has applied science business and literature
while is the repository of art music and foreign languages
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service
this kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course
public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis
local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library
the system passes on these savings to its members
further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing
books are not the only resource of the system
schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities
the most recent film catalogue available at each library lists titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook of the north the nightingale and the red balloon
workshops are conducted by the consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service
the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together
consequently an experienced librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote library activities cooperating with the librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits
headquarters has also set up a central juvenile and center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection
sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups
story hours programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the consultant
headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries
in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county
it prepares cooperative displays posters booklists brochures and other promotional material for use in member libraries
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used
and it publishes sum and substance a monthly newsletter which reports the activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership
in nassau as in other systems the objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general
librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today
library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans the
to them especially the librarians with the help of hope they will never have to say sorry we have that book
today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world
the need for lifetime reading is apparent
education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society
the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read
if we are not discriminating in our reading
if we do not know how to use what we do read
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries
although progress has been made in system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america
the problem grows in intensity each year as knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition
there are for example approximately people in this country with no public library service and about with inadequate service
in college libraries per cent of the total number of books are owned by of institutions surveyed last year by the office of education
and over per cent of the elementary schools with or more pupils do not have any library at all
in every aspect of service to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services
only public understanding and support can provide that service
